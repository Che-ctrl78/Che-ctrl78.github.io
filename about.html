    <h2>Khoa Tran</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Khoa, a founder of this project. I designed the models for the engineering kits and worked in optimization to ensure that our products can be enjoyed by all with no experience, or know how needed. I'm a Junior at Wilmington High School and I am a member of the Wilmington Robotics club in which I design parts for our robot designed to compete in rigorous environments, which made it to States.</p>
